## Integration Verification

### Cross-Phase Data Flow

| Flow | Phases | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| Check-in task action → list sync | 7 | ✅ Connected |
| Planning tasks → overdue included | 8 | ✅ Connected |
| Notes panel → dialog props | 6 | ✅ Connected |

### Query Consistency (TaskRepository)

All overdue task queries use consistent criteria:
- `dueDate < today` (explicit overdue)
- `category='today' AND dn.date < today AND dueDate IS NULL` (implicit overdue)

Verified in:
- `findOverdueTasks()` - used by CheckInController
- `findUnplannedTasksForToday()` - used by PlanningController

### API Protection

All API routes protected with `#[CurrentUser]` attribute.

### Orphaned/Missing

- Orphaned exports: 0
- Missing connections: 0
- Broken flows: 0

## Known Limitations

1. **PLAN-02 (Task splitting):** Verified working as designed. AI splits tasks when appropriate based on duration/complexity. No bug found.

2. **No-dueDate overdue tasks:** Fix applied but not manually tested (user had already cleaned up test data). Code logic verified correct.

## Conclusion

v1.1 Bugfixes milestone is **READY FOR RELEASE**.

All 11 requirements implemented:
- Phase 6: 6 notes panel fixes
- Phase 7: 2 UI behavior fixes
- Phase 8: 3 AI planning fixes

Integration verified across all phases with no conflicts or regressions.
